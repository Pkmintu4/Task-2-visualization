📊 Superstore Sales Analysis Dashboard
A Power BI Project by a Data Super-Manager
🌟 Project Overview
This project turns the Sample Superstore Dataset into a 1-page interactive command center. Instead of looking at thousands of rows in Excel, this dashboard uses colorful maps and charts to show exactly how the store is performing in different states, product categories, and over time.

🏗️ What’s Inside the Dashboard?
1. The Map (Where is the money?)
Visual: Bubble Map

Goal: Shows State-wise Sales. Big bubbles mean that state is a "Superstore Superstar!"

2. Product Power (What are we selling?)
Bar Chart: Shows Sub-Category Sales (like Chairs vs. Paper).

Stacked Column Chart: Shows Category Sales & Profit (Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology).

3. The Time Machine (When did we sell it?)
Line & Area Charts: Tracks Monthly Sales and Profit Trends. This helps us see if we sell more toys in the Summer or during the Holidays!

4. Customer Pizza (Who is buying?)
Donut & Pie Charts: Shows how much Segments (Home Office, Corporate, Consumer) and Regions (East, West, etc.) contribute to our total sales.

5. The Data Lab (The nitty-gritty numbers)
Matrix: A smart table showing Category > Sub-Category > Sales & Profit.

Table: A detailed list of every order, including Date, State, and Category.

🕹️ Interactive Controls (The Slicers)
You can "filter" the whole report by clicking these buttons:

Region: See only the North, South, East, or West.

Category: Focus on just Technology or Furniture.

Segment: See how families shop vs. big businesses.

Year: Travel back in time to see last year’s data!
